## Description
Music has been a long-standing part of the world’s cultures and easily accessible through streaming services, like Spotify and Apple Music. You have almost all the music in the world today right at your fingertips. 
 
Alongside the accessibility of music, there was a rise to music data accessibility as well. Artists now know how many people like and/or listen to their music, or in other words, a track’s popularity. In this project, we will create models based on audio features and other track information to predict popular and top hits. These models may have the potential to predict the next top hit before it is even released. Imagine that!  

Since it would be in the best interest of a record company to consistently produce popular songs, being able to use a song’s audio features to predict if it will be a hit or not will aid in making managerial decisions regarding which songs to produce.
